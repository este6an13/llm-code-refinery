        CURRENT SOLUTION:
        def get_difference(numbers):
    smallest = None

    for num in numbers:
        # Sum digit calculation using a more Pythonic way with divmod
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

        if digit_sum == 30:
            if smallest is None or num < smallest:
                smallest = num

Final Solution:

    for num in numbers:
        # Optimized sum of digits using arithmetic
        original_num = num
        digit_sum = 0
        while num > 0:
            digit_sum += num % 10
            num //= 10

        if digit_sum == 30:
            if original_num < smallest:
                smallest = original_num
            if original_num > largest:
                largest = original_num

    if smallest != float('inf') and largest != -float('inf'):
        return largest - smallest

        return 0

# Test with an example list 'random_numbers'
# difference = get_difference(random_numbers)
# print("Difference:", difference)
