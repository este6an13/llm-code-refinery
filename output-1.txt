    Write Python code to solve this problem:

Write a function `get_difference` that takes a list of 1 million random integers (each between 1 and 100,000) as input and returns an integer: the difference between the smallest and largest numbers in the list whose digits sum up to 30.



        Here is the current Python solution :
        Optimize it for faster execution.


        CURRENT SOLUTION:
        def get_difference(numbers):
    def digit_sum(n):
        """Helper function to compute the sum of the digits of an integer n."""
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

    # List to store numbers with digit sum of 30
    valid_numbers = [num for num in numbers if digit_sum(num) == 30]

    # If no numbers with digit sum 30 exist, return None or appropriate value
    if not valid_numbers:
        return None  # or you could return 0 if none found (based on expected behavior)

    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers
    max_num = max(valid_numbers)
    min_num = min(valid_numbers)

    return max_num - min_num

# Example usage:
# numbers = generate_large_input()  # Suppose this function generates the large list
# difference = get_difference(numbers)
# print(f"Difference: {difference}")
